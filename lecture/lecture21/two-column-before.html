<div>
	<p id="p1">An honest person speaks only what is the truth and engages only in honest activity at all times. Honesty gives us great moral strength. It requires courage and boldness to be honest, as being honest may sometimes be difficult.</p>
	<p id="p2">I star to reading book when i in grade 3.my brother inspired me to do that. I usualy share my hobby with my friend and my english teacher.By reading, I get better at concentration because it requires me to focus on what I am reading for long periods. It also opens up the knowledge door for me.</p>
